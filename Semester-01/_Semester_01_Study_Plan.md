# Study Plan: Semester 01 - Foundations of Computation

This document outlines the study plan for the first semester of my self-taught journey in Computer Science, covering Calculus, Introductory Programming with Python, and Discrete Mathematics.

## üìö Books

* **Guidorizzi, "Um Curso de C√°lculo, Vol. 1"**: A classic and robust text. The progression is linear and rigorous, starting with the foundation of real numbers and functions, moving on to limits, derivatives, and finally, integrals. The theory is dense, and the exercises are crucial for consolidation.
* **Allen B. Downey, "Think Python"**: A book with an extremely practical and didactic approach. It builds programming knowledge incrementally, starting from the most basic elements of the language (variables, operators) and progressively advancing to more complex structures like functions, lists, dictionaries, and classes. Each chapter ends with exercises that directly apply the presented concepts.
* **Kenneth H. Rosen, "Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications"**: The standard reference in the field. It is a comprehensive book that covers the pillars of mathematics for computation. The initial chapters on Logic (Ch. 1), Sets, and Functions (Ch. 2) are the theoretical basis for the rest of the course and for developing algorithmic reasoning.

## üéØ Study Plan Strategy

The plan interleaves the three books to ensure the learning process is varied and complementary. **Python programming (Thursday)** will serve as a practical tool to explore theoretical concepts from **Calculus (Friday)** and **Discrete Mathematics (Saturday)**. **Sunday** will be a day for integrated practice and review, essential for connecting the dots. Every 4 weeks, there will be a consolidation week to review and apply knowledge in a small project.

### Daily Structure (2 hours):
* **Active Review (15% - 18 min):** Review the content from the previous day in the same subject.
* **Focused Reading (45% - 54 min):** Study the theory from the designated chapters.
* **Applied Practice (40% - 48 min):** Solve exercises from the book or implement code examples.
