# My Computer Science Journey 🚀

## 📖 About This Repository

Welcome to my logbook! This repository serves as a public and continuous record of my self-taught journey in Computer Science. Here, you will find my notes, solved exercises, small projects, and all the material I am developing throughout my studies.

## 🎯 The Starting Point

My journey into the world of programming began in **August 2025** with a Python training course. Although brief, this experience was incredibly enriching and opened my horizons to the vast possibilities that technology offers. From that moment on, I started exploring other topics independently, always seeking to deepen my knowledge.

## 💡 The Turning Point: Towards Computer Science

Over time, I realized that to become a truly skilled developer capable of solving complex problems efficiently, I needed a more solid theoretical foundation. That's when I understood the fundamental importance of Computer Science concepts.

Faced with the impossibility of enrolling in a formal university course at the moment, I decided to take a proactive and alternative path. I used artificial intelligence (specifically Gemini) as my mentor to build a personalized study curriculum that simulates a Computer Science degree. The AI helped me structure:

* A complete syllabus, divided into semesters and subjects.
* A selection of books and reference materials for each topic.
* A detailed study plan, based on the content of the books.

Essentially, this repository is the practical result of my "private Computer Science course."

## 🏗️ Repository Structure

To keep everything organized and easy to navigate, I have adopted a nested folder structure. The organization follows the logic of my study plan:

```text
cs-learning-log/
│
├── 📁 Semester-01/
│   ├── 📄 _Semester_01_Study_Plan.md  // General info, books, and goals
│   ├── 📁 Week-01/
│   │   ├── 📁 Day-01/
│   │   │   ├── 📄 Data_Structures_Notes.md
│   │   │   └── 📁 exercises/
│   │   ├── 📁 Day-02/
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── 📁 Week-02/
│   └── ...
│
├── 📁 Semester-02/
│   └── ...
│
└── 📁 Semester-03/
    └── ...
```

* **`Semester-XX`**: Each semester of the study plan has its own root folder.
* **`_Semester_XX_Study_Plan.md`**: Inside each semester, a main file describes the subjects, reference books, and overall goals for that period.
* **`Week-XX`**: Each week of study is a subfolder.
* **`Day-XX`**: And finally, each day of study also has its own folder, containing the notes and exercises from that date.

## 📈 The Future

This is a long-term project. My goal is to consistently update this repository over the next **2 to 4 years**, documenting every step of my learning process. I hope that by the end of this journey, this space will not only represent my personal and professional growth but may also inspire or help others who are on a similar path.
